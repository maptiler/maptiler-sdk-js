## 1.0.12
### New Features
- Added a new language flag `Language.STYLE_LOCK` to force keep the language form the style and prevent any further update. Can be at a sigle map instance level (via constuctor option `language`) or via global config (`config.primaryLanguage`)
### Bug Fixes
- The fallback language was `{name:latin}`, it is now replaced by `{name}`, which is for the local name (present by default for many places while `latin` is less frequent).

## 1.0.8
### Bug Fixes
- Since v1.0.7, the `Map` primary language (when custom) was no longer persistant on style update.

## 1.0.7
### New Features
- The `apiKey` can now be specified in the `Map` constructor (will propagate to `config`)
- The `language` can now be speficifed in the `Map` constructo (will **not** propagete to `config` and will apply only to this specific instance)
- `Map` now has the method `.getSdkConfig()` to retrieve the config object. 
- `Map` now has the method `.getMaptilerSessionId()` to retrieve the MapTiler session ID
Both `.getSdkConfig()` and `.getMaptilerSessionId()` are handy for layers or control built outside of the SDK that still need some of the configuration to interact with the server. Those components do not always have access to the internal of the SDK (especially that the config is scoped) but can access to the `Map` instance to which they are added with the implementation of the `.onAdd()` method.

## 1.0.6
### New Features
- Now exposing `MaptilerGeolocateControl` for external initialization if needed
- Now exposing `MaptilerTerrain` for external initialization if needed

## 1.0.5
### New Features
- Terrain elevation is now using MapTiler's `terrain-rgb-v2`

## 1.0.4
### Others
- Improved the geolocate control behavior by not zooming out

## 1.0.3
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed the usage of relative path style JSON (in `Map` constructor and `.setStyle()`)

## 1.0.2
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed the dependency scheme of MapLibre import.

## 1.0.1
### Others
- Reducing the NPM size by ignoring documentation images

## 1.0.0
### Others
- First public version!
