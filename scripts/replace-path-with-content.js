/**
 * This script takes a text file as input and a text file as output.
 * The input text is supposed to contain occurences of filepath between
 * square brackets such as "foo bar [some/file/path.txt] foofoo barbar".
 * 
 * This script replaces this pattern by the actual content of the file
 * between square brackets.
 * 
 * The main purpose is to inject actual SVG string (URL encoded) into CSS
 * for `background-image` properties. If need be, we could also apply the
 * same logic for more file types such as png with base64 string.
 * 
 * This script is used by rollup.config.js , so check there to see it in
 * application.
